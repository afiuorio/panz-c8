# panc-8

panc-8 is an emulator for the CHIP-8 system written in C. At the moment the emulator doesn't support sound.

## Build

panc-8 requires [SDL 2.0](http://www.libsdl.org). In the repository there is a makefile for build the emulator on OSX, but it should be easy to build it on other operating systems.
